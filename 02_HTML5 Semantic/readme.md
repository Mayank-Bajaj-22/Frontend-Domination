Sometimes, just by looking at a tag, it's not clear what exactly you're going to build.
This issue is largely addressed by HTML5 semantics.

by only seeing div we can not say that on your page where that div is going like
    footer 
    aside 
    header
    article
    audio
    video
    section
    nav

<!-- kai bar tag ko dekh kr ye nahi btaya ja skta ki aap exactly kya banane wale ho, is cheej ko kaafi haad tak solve krta hai html5 schematics -->
<!-- ye saare tags aside, article, nav, section, footer, header apne aap mein kuch nhi krte -->
<!-- 1. header = pahla section of website can be called header -->
<!-- 2. nav = navigation bar -->
<!-- 3. main = poori website isi m aayegi -->
<!-- 4. section = pages of website -->
<!-- 5. article = website ke andar ko sub elements honge unko article mein daal skte hai -->
<!-- 6. aside = side mein usually jo fixed elements hote hai unke liye hota hai mainly -->
<!-- 7. footer =  footer banane ke liye -->
<!-- 8. audio = audio support ke liye -->
<!-- 9. video = video support dene ke liye -->

Using HTML5 semantics increase SEO
