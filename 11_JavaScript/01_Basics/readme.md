## js the language
    - managed by ecmascript
    - naye features, puraane htana, kharab features sahi krna and overall development of js
    - es5 (var) and es6 (let)
    - js the language = code likkhna seekhna, main features
    - js the dom = code linkhar cheejein banana seekhna

### basics :
    - file connect karenge and load karenge script ko, basics of code execution, grammer and understanding of errors

### inbuilt features :
    - intrepeters pe hi chalti h inbuilt  
    - console(log, warn, error) , alert , prompt
    - prompt is just like brother of alert but it ask something to type with alert, which is used later
    - java compiler based language hai and c also

- har programming language me data se deal krna hota hai, wo alag alag prakar ka ho skta hai, ab aisa data jisse humein deal karna hai, wo save to krna padeg na, to wo data save krne ke liye hume koi saving space chahiye jaha par data save hojaaye and ye save krne ke liye unhe kuchh naam bhi dena padega and isilye humein variables and constants banaane padte hai taaki data save hojaaeand unka koi naam bhi ho taaki hum baad mein unhe access kar paaye

### variables and constants :
    - variables and constants data ko store krne ke kaam aate hai, variables me data store and change nhi kr skte h but in constant ek fix data hi store ho skta hai and dono hi browser par memory late hai and browser RAM par chalta hai to technically dono RAM par chalte hai ya fir space lete hai

### compilers and interpreters
    - js the language english words use krti hai and computers english nahi smjhte hai 0 and 1 jisko current flow and current bypass bhi kah skte ho, hum chaate hai ki hum english mein likhne computer  se baat krle , to hum ek translator laayenge joki hamara code english mein lega and usko 0 and 1 mein convert kr dega

    - interpreters -> byte code -> machine code
    - compilers -> machine code
    - compiler and interpeters translators hai jo ki english code ko convert kr rhe hai machine code mein
    - jit compiler - interpreter ki shuraati takkat use krta hai and compiler ki running takkat use krta hai 

### window
    - there are many features which are frequently used in js and they are the not the parts of js, they are not the part of js the language but they are available in the browser, and when you see them in js they are called from the browser

    - window ek bucket samjh lo jismein wo cheeje available hai jo browser deta hai js mein use karne ke liye kyuki wo saari cheejein js ka part nahi balki browser ka part hai which is available to use in js, we can also say that they are provided by browser to use in js, all these features which are made available via browser are put inside window


### types - primitive and reference data types
    - [] () {} - reference data types
    - types matlab data ka roop
    - example of data types:
        - harsh - string
        - 12 - integer
        - 12.3 - float
        - 22.0 - float
        - true - boolean
        - a - character
